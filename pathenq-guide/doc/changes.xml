<h1>Tree-view Navigation</h1>
<p>This release brings basic keyboard navigation to the tree-view that might be novel in a web app, but is standard in desktop applications:</p>
<p>See <a href="/pathenq/reviewing/treeview">Tree-view Panel</a></p>
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<p>Use the <code>Up</code> / <code>Down</code> cursor keys to move quickly up and down the element hierarchy shown in the tree. To expand or collapse a tree node, use the <code>right</code> and <code>left</code> buttons respectively.</p>
<h2>Result-item Binding</h2>
<p>There is now a 2-way binding between the Tree-view and the the Result-items table. So selecting an item/node in one, will automatically highlight the corresponding item in the other (if there is a match).</p>
<p>With the Tree-view, or Results table selected, pressing the <code>Enter</code> key or the <code>Use</code> button results in the Results table being updated to show details of attributes and child elements of the current element.</p>
