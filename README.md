[PathEnq](http://qutoric.com/xslt/pathenq) ===========================XML Analyser and XPath 2.0 Editor----------------------------------------![Screenshot](http://www.qutoric.com/xslt/pathenq-guide/docimg/enqtree.png)PathEnq is an online web application - predominantly coded in XSLT 2.0, with some JavaScript.As an XSLT 2.0 application, this project has a dependency on a third-party XSLT 2.0 processor, Saxon-CE from Saxonica Limited.XSLT Formatting------------------Note that commited XSLT code has no indentation characters for XML, just for multi-line XPath expressions, this is because a 'virtual formatting' editor was used prior to the initial commit.This makes editing and differencing simpler (at least for me), but does mean that the code when viewed in GitHub and other non-XML tools won't appear to be properly indented.
